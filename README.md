# Scheme Files (files.scheme.org)

* No original content. Do modify or aggregate any files for the sake
  of `files.scheme.org`. Only store bit-identical copies of files that
  have been released elsewhere.

* Download a copy of the file using `wget` and record the URL as
  `original-url` in `files.scm`.

* If the file is not retrievable programmatically using a simple HTTP
  or FTP downloader (e.g. `wget`), and needs manual navigation of some
  kind, use `indirect-original-url` instead.
